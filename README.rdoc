=ConfigFiles

A simple library to specify the format of configuration files and the 
way to turn their data into Ruby objects. 

Ruby1.9 centric. "Lazy" to some extent and as needed. 

No write support: it's strongly sugested to use ERB or other 
templating systems for that.

A good example usage is found at http:/github.com/gderosa/dansguardian.rb .
